# pinfo
A simple CLI tool to analyse your code structures over mulitple projects. Support for Swift, Kotlina and Objective-C.

This project was initialy created for helping me understand the IO - monad. Some of the code might looked out of place and plain wrong. The algoritm is *very* naivly implemented. But I think its good enough to get an overview of your projects.
